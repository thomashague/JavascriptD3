# JavascriptD3

This project taught me how to make visualizations from scratch using Javascript and its D3 library. It made me appreciate visualization tools... 

D3 provides ultimate customization because like I said, you build from scratch. You determine everything -- the size, location, and other characteristics of the axes, data points, and other graph features. This is powerful for projects that have strict visual requirements that can't be fulfilled by a tool like Excel or Tableau. 

I first compiled a csv file using data from the Census and the Center for Disease Control. The data shows the correlation between poverty and limited internet usage. Given the power of the internet to connect and teach people, I think providing access to internet services to the poor is very important. This visualization explores the relationship between poverty and internet usage by state.

After compiling the csv, I wrote javascript within an HTML file that displays the data in a scatterplot. Admittedly, the graph itself isn't a beauty (time constraint). But the idea is that given a csv file, I can use Javascript to display custom graphs on web pages. Open the html file to see the graph.
